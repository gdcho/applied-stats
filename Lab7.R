# 1. Suppose we are drawing cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacement.
# Using dhyper, create a table and a barplot that gives that exact probability
# distribution for ùëã = the number of Aces obtained when drawing 8 cards without
# replacement. Give clear and descriptive labels for your barplot

# draw 8 cards from a 52 card deck (without replacement -> makes it hypergeometric)
# X = number of Aces you get

N <- 52
K <- 4 # aces
n <- 8 # sample size

# e.g. P(X=3)
dhyper(3, K, N-K, n) # success, failure, sample size

# becomes small enough that it gets rounded to 0.0000.) Record the probability
# distribution as both a table and a bar plot.
